# Boolean Logic Assignment: 2-CNF Satisfiability

## Task Overview
This assignment involves solving the satisfiability problem for Boolean formulas in 2-CNF format. The task has two parts:
1. Check Satisfiability: Determine if the given 2-CNF formula is satisfiable (i.e., if there exists a truth assignment for the variables that makes the formula true).
2. Find Satisfying Assignment: If the formula is satisfiable, return a satisfying assignment for the variables.

The formula is provided as a string, and you are required to implement two Python functions that perform these tasks.

## File Descriptions
- boolean.py: Contains the implementation of the two main tasks:
  - is_satisfiable(formula: str) -> bool: Checks if the formula is satisfiable.
  - sat_assignment(formula: str) -> dict: Returns a satisfying assignment or None if unsatisfiable.
- README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the assignment, the problem, and how to run the code.

## Functions Overview

### is_satisfiable(formula: str) -> bool
This function takes a 2-CNF formula as a string and checks if it is satisfiable. It uses a 2-SAT algorithm to determine whether there is an assignment of truth values that satisfies all the clauses.

### sat_assignment(formula: str) -> dict
If the formula is satisfiable, this function returns a dictionary containing one possible satisfying assignment. If the formula is not satisfiable, the function returns None.

## Running the Code
To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
3. Run the Python file boolean.py and test the functions with a sample 2-CNF formula.

```bash
boolean.py
